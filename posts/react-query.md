# What is Server State?

Server state is the data your frontend app synchronizes with your backend. When you query data from an external API, you often want to manage the state of your data, your loading state, error state, caching, and more. This is a complicated task, and thankfully React Query manages it all for us.

# Creating a React App

To get started with React Query, we'll create a basic React application with Create React App. Simply run `npx create-react-app react-query` after navigating to your desired directory.

To get started using React Query, you would simply need to install the package via your favorite package manager. If you're using NPM, run `npm i react-query`.
