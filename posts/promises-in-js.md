# What are JavaScript promises?

Promises, by definition, are objects that encapsulate the result of an asynchronous operation. They are a much cleaner alternative to callbacks and enable working with async code in a much cleaner and more readable way.

A promise can take on one of three states:
**Pending**, **fulfilled**, or **rejected**. Letâ€™s explore them in more detail.

A promise is initially **pending**. Once its result has been reached, and it is either **resolved** or **rejected**, it is said to be **settled**. If the promise was successful, i.e. it resolved to a value, it is said to be **fulfilled**.

Consider the following example:

```js
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let value;
  let errors = false;
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (errors) {
      reject('An error occured.');
    }

    value = 5;
    resolve(value);
  }, 1000);
});

myPromise.then(
  (value) => console.log(value),
  (reason) => console.error(reason)
);

// logs (after 1 second):
// 5
```

As you can tell, the `Promise` constructor takes a callback function as an argument, which in turn receives two other callbacks, `resolve` and `reject`. Promises can either be resolved with a **value**, or rejected with a **reason**. To resolve a promise, we simply call the `resolve` callback and provide the value to be passed on. To reject, we call the `reject` callback, and pass in the reason for the rejection.

The `.then()` block that follows will be called **asynchronously** after the promise has been resolved or rejected. It takes in two (optional) callback arguments -- the first for the resolved case, and the second for the rejected case.
In our example, the promise has been resolved with the value `5` after one second. This event fired the first callback in the `.then()` block, which received the value `5` as an argument. The value can then be accessed in the function body.

Another example, this time of a rejected promise, can be seen here:

```js
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let value;
  let errors = false;

  setTimeout(() => {
    errors = true;
    if (errors) {
      reject('An error occured.');
    }
    value = 5;
    resolve(value);
  }, 1000);
});

myPromise.then(
  (value) => console.log(value),
  (reason) => console.error(reason)
);

// logs (after one second):
// 'An error occured.'
```

This time, since `errors` was set to `true`, the promise has been rejected. This event triggered the second callback and the reason for the rejection was logged to the console.

# then().catch(): an alternative syntax

To improve readability, we can replace the rejection callback inside the `.then` block with a `.catch` block.

The previous example can also be rewritten as follows:

```js
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let value;
  let errors = false;

  setTimeout(() => {
    errors = true;
    if (errors) {
      reject('An error occured.');
    }
    value = 5;
    resolve(value);
  }, 1000);
});

myPromise
  .then((value) => console.log(value))
  .catch((reason) => console.error(reason));

// logs (after one second):
// 'An error occured.'
```

This results in the exact same output, but improves readability.

Alternatively, we can only handle rejected promises with the `.catch` block:

```js
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let value;
  let errors = false;

  setTimeout(() => {
    errors = true;
    if (errors) {
      reject('An error occured.');
    }
    value = 5;
    resolve(value);
  }, 1000);
});

myPromise.catch((reason) => console.error(reason));

// logs (after one second):
// 'An error occured.'
```

Which is equivalent to:

```js
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let value;
  let errors = false;

  setTimeout(() => {
    errors = true;
    if (errors) {
      reject('An error occured.');
    }
    value = 5;
    resolve(value);
  }, 1000);
});

myPromise.then(undefined, (reason) => console.error(reason));

// logs (after one second):
// 'An error occured.'
```

This basic introduction has provided you with tools required to get started with promises. However, promises have much more built into them than we covered.
